For using **Division2-Loadout**, visit:
### https://division2-loadout.github.io/ui/

<br>

More functionalities and updates will be added soon.<br>
If you find this tool useful, feel free to make a request and we will try to work on it.<br>

### What is the purpose of this app?
- The main purpose is to track loadouts and builds we have set in-game.
- Allow us to have a copy of loadouts we have in-game.
- We can make as many loadouts as we want.
- Loadouts can be tagged by character: Char1/Char2/Char3/Char4/Stash.
- Loadouts can be tagged by purpose: Loadout/Build/Set/Other.
- Share loadouts with other people.
- Get a general view of the loadout stats.
- Export/Import loadouts.
- The data is stored locally on your browser.

<br>

### What is NOT the purpose of this app?
- This is not live data from Division 2. 
- There is no API to use, so we cannot get our in-game loadouts.
- This app is not meant for making detailed builds. You should use [mxswat/mx-division-builds](https://mxswat.github.io/mx-division-builds) for that purpose.

<br>

### **Disclaimer**: 
The weapon and specialization sections don't have any impact on the stats numbers for the moment. <br>

The stats block (offensive/defensive/utility/DMG/Armor/Health) is a basic represenation of the values extracted from the gear. 
For the moment, this is not considering some bonus values.
